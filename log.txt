      - Built a random maze generator that the user can specify a size for
      - Size varies from 15x15 to 50x50
      - A navigation mesh is generated for the maze after being created so that two "mice" can compete to solve it as quickly as possible
      - Player can put a bet on the game by choosing which "mouse" they think will win
      - There is a bet multiplier which is determined by the size of the maze
    - Added a new "shop" room
      - Inside the shop is a "fish tank" underneath the floor, where there is an implementation of a flocking AI, with two lots of fish that swim in groups
      - User can purchase "undetectable pickpocketing" and "running shoes" from the NPC in this shop
      - Each new "powerup" has a corresponding image, displayed in a list in the top left, alongside where the image for when the user has a key is displayed
    - Revamped lobby room with disco floor, music and a DJ NPC
      - Lobby now contains 25 NPCs instead of the 10 previously
      - NPCs now dance in the lobby, the energy of their dancing is influenced by the volume of the music
      - The user can change the volume of the music by adjusting the UI slider that is placed on a table in front of the DJ NPC
      - If the music is set to >90% volume, everyone in the lobby (including the Wardens) will congregate in the centre of the lobby and dance on the dance floor with the high energy dance animation
    - Sound effects have been added for:
      - Hovering and clicking on buttons
      - When purchasing an item,
      - Winning/losing/drawing a game of Blackjack/Rummy

      - When player is caught pickpocketing
    - Revamped main menu

      - AI now attempts min/max by building knowledge of other opponentsâ€™ cards and which cards have been discarded to better determine which cards to pickup/discard

      - UI shows cards being dealt at the beginning of the game
    - Added new effects to "Space" scene
